## ‚ÑπÔ∏è 1. Introduction: 

This repository does include a simple implementation of 3D rooms using equirectangular textures in THREE.js. But what does this mean?
Actually you can insert some images into the `/rooms` directory and add the images names to the list `rooms` in `index.html`.

Then if you start the node-project as mentioned in `3. Deployment` you are able to visit 3D locations in your browser.

This tool may be helpful for smaller business to add an impression of your local shop to your website. You may also be working for a museum or
a sightseeing agency and want to give some preview what customers may see when visiting you. You may also be a self-employed real estate agent 
and want your customers to get an impression of a real estate location without buying expensive software. Then this tool will definitely help you.

## üîß 2. Requirements:

- Node JS

## üî® 3. Deployment:

- Clone this repository
- cd into the local repository
- type the following command to install npm dependencies:

  npm install
  
- run the node-js project using the following command:

  node server.js
  
- open up `localhost:3000` in your web browser.

http://localhost:3000[localhost:3000]

## ‚ûï 4. Adding new rooms:

To add new rooms you can do as follows:

- Think about a name for your room, e.g. `living room`.
- Add the name to the array `rooms` in line 19 of `index.html`.
- Place the image file as jpg in the `/rooms` directory.

WARNING: The image needs to be a jpg file and also needs to be in a https://onix-systems.medium.com/how-to-use-360-equirectangular-panoramas-for-greater-realism-in-games-55fadb0547da[equirectangular format].

- Now after starting the application, buttons for all configured rooms will be added to the website.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è 5. Upcoming features:

- Removal of the duty of adding the room names to the `rooms` in the `index.html`. Instead the images from the directory `/rooms` will automatically be read and the buttons will be generated from the image names.
- opportunities to add the 3d virtual environment viewer to your website and to change the style
- maybe centralised deployment and opportunity for business to register and host your rooms in a stable environment.
